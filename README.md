What and why?
Code has been written to help manage hunting sessions in online game called Tibia. It saves a lot of time when it comes to split the profits or the hunt or just keep an eye on the worthiness of the sessions.

How it is made?
Hunting session has the specific template filled with values, for example time of session, experience gain or profit from hunt. Methods are called through the button in spreadsheet page. Afterwards, the values are gathered and then many statistics are counted, mostly averages. Application can also recognize place of the hunt and monsters which has been slain.

Good to know.
This specific code has been designed to be used with party hunts - for one-man hunt browse through my github repository.
